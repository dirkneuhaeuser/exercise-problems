## Order Statistic Tree
Order Statistic Tree (OST) is a balanced BST, which also saves the size of each subtree. 
This datastructure can be used to answer order-related queries like "what it the k-th smallest elment?" on dynammic data in log(n) time (as we have to find the specific node first in log(n).

An alternative to OST is a Fenwick Tree, as implemented [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/order-statistic-tree-using-fenwick-tree-bit/). 
However, this only works for finding the order of indices (small integers), while the OST implemented as a balanced Redâ€“black tree can take any type with smaller-comperator.

When using it as a **multiset** (and allow the same value several times), we have to take the operator `less_equal`. However, this comes with some pitfalls as well:

`find` will always return end. </br>
`lower_bound` works like upper_bound in normal set (to return the first element > it)</br>
`upper_bound` works like lower_bound in normal set (to return the first element >= it)</br>
`order_of_key` will get you the first order of the key (even though this key might be available by many orders)</br>
`find_by_order` works as expected</br>
`erase` by value does not work anymore. Use `t.erase(t.upper_bound(1))`</br>

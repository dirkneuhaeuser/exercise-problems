|[kattis - Piano](https://open.kattis.com/problems/piano)| Maxflow - standard |[c++](https://github.com/dirkneuhaeuser/algorithms/blob/master/problems/network_flow/standard/kattis_piano.cpp) | Either use heap or Maxflow as it is an assignment problem (pianos to days). Important: MaxFlow problem become NP-hard if you need to add condition on edge to either use it to full capacity or not at all. E.g. piano needs to be delivered by two workers. However, these workes are not allowed to work on different days. If this is the case: try to model the problem differently. Here, we just use a weight of 1 instead of 2 and therfore the capacities of a single day by 2. |

We connect all banks to be robbed to the source, and all frame-out of city nodes to the sink. Note, Vertex capacity of 1 also implise edge capacity of 1, so we can actually mess with their capacity, I set it to INF, but 1 would also be ok. |

Note we don't need to bother that maximal 1 person can be on the iceberg at the same time, as people can just stay at their previsous place as long as possible.

Therefore, let the bottom be the source, and the top be the sink. Build up the graph via the robotor nodes: Whenever two nodes intersect, then connect these in the mincut graph. Also all nodes which are at the bottom (y<=d) gets connected to source and all at the top (y>=y_field-d) get conected to sink. Note, you have to apply vertex capacity, as each robotor can only be used once: Now whenever you can can, connect source and sink, it is not possible to omit MinCut obstacles. |

Idea: Place bottlenecks of bottom and top components on opposite sides: Bottom elements have bottleneck towards the sorce and have INF capacity towards the sink. For Top elements vice versa. This set up alone will give us the cost for placing the elements when not considering the interconnection cost. Now an interconnection cost r can increase the min-cut(overall cost), iff connected with top and bottom elements: This way, we can use the INF part of either parts and thus increase by r. However, when the interconnection cost is in-between two components of the same side, then, the bottleneck will prevent an increase. |

In order to properly model '>', '<' and '=' you need to construct 2 graphs. The first will take care of all mandatory flows ('=' and if > x, then you also need at least a flow of x+1). The remaining row-sums can be allocated/flowed via another graph. Note you can't take the same graph, as then the algorithm might revoke some must flows. |

Where the edge from source to the other teams has the capacity of the difference towards your highscore (they can not make more points than you in total). Then each team is connected to its opcoming matches (with capacity 2). If the maxflow can assign all points from all remaining matches, then you can win still |

Then create a max flow problem. Each each has a capacity of 1. To deal with the fact, that a road could be used more than once at different times, we repeat the maxflow for each possible dinstance towards the downtown. |

A fence between two cells is an bidrectional edge between them. Then from each dark cell you need to find the mincut to the frame. Greedily circle around all dark cells doesn't work here, as you might have some bright cells inside the dark territory which you better not fence up (like en enclave). Make the frame the sink and connect each dark field to the source with capacity INF. |

Now in order to get the lowest lexicographical order, we want to set N as early as possible. Therefore, we go through the grid and see if the edge between rowsum i and colsum j has been activated. If so, we reset it 0 (here is the actual problem of this problem, we can't brueforce all n*m - times the max flow. We are only allowed to reset a specific edges in order to keep us from TLE). So find the right index of all contributing edges (so from source to row i, from row i to col j and from col j to sink) and subtract 1 from forward flow and add 1 to backward flow. Now try dinic again. If the result is 1, then the network found an alternative way activating any cell after the current cell (as all the others have already been fixed). |

|[kattis - landscaping](https://open.kattis.com/problems/landscaping)| Maxflow - Variants |[c++](https://github.com/dirkneuhaeuser/algorithms/blob/master/problems/network_flow/variants/kattis_landscaping.cpp) | The most difficult max flow problem for me. Connect all down-fields with source and all up fields with sink, both with capacity B. Now connect each neighboud element with capacity A. Each cell can then cause only B trouble and has the task to give the reamining flow to its neighbours. Two cases for higher fields (WLOG also for lower): **1. Case:** A higher field has less input flow than B, then transfer all of it to the sink (no changes) **2. Case:** A higher field has more input flow than B, then the field takes B and allocates the remaining toward its neighbours. Lets assume we only have one high neighbour. case 2.1 Remaining to this high neighbour is more than A: Send only A. The equivalent is, that the current high field will be changed to low field. case 2.2 Remining to this neighbour is less than A: Send less than A. The equivalent is, that the current high field stays high field (Its not worth it, as changing to a lower field will not get rid of the border between the now low and the still high neighbour field. |

Then subtract the costs of using these positive blocks. That is caclulated via maxflow: Each block with pos. weight w, can only caus costs <= w. So connect all positive blocks to the source with weight w. Then add edges towards the obstacles with INF. Finally, connect all neg blocks with weight z to the sink with capcaity -z. The maxflow will give you then the total cost of adding all positve blocks, limited be not negative for each block (or rather synergy of blocks).|

Here each location comes with a vertex capacity, given by the amount of people needed to defend that place. Connection all neighbours up to the frame, will lead to a correct min-cut result. Note, when having vertex-capacities, you actually need to connect each vertex with all 4 neighbours. It is not sufficient to connect from top to bottom and left to right. |

To test each field would timeout, as naive comes with O((dx*dy)^2), Note the window in WC is bigger than dx or dy. Better Idea: For each cell, we need to test a certain cube. These cubes are very much overlapping. However, the diagonal nature of these cubes make it difficult to precalculate sums. Therefore, rotate each cell by 45 degees, such that you have normal rectangles. Now you can calculate a 2D Prefixsum, which is NOT kadane. In kadane we would only prefixsum over each row and then 'kadende' over all possible l and r column combination. Here, however, we do not need to look at windows of variable size. The window-size is fixed, so each cell we get in O(1) with 2D Prefixsum, leading to overall O(dx*dy) |
